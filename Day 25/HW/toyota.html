    In 1924, Sakichi Toyoda invented the Toyoda Model G Automatic loom.<br>
    The principle of jidoka, which means the machine stops itself when a problem occurs, became later a part of the Toyota Production System.<br>
    Looms were built on a small production line. In 1929, the patent for the automatic loom was sold to the British company Platt Brothers,<br>
    [2][3] generating the starting capital for automobile development.[4][5]<br>
    

    Under the direction of the founder's son, Kiichiro Toyoda,<br>
    [6][7][8] Toyoda Automatic Loom Works established an Automobile Division on September 1, 1933,<br>
    and formally declared its intention to begin manufacturing automobiles on January 29, 1934.[6][9]<br>
    A prototype Toyota Type A engine was completed on September 25, 1934, with the company's first prototype sedan,<br>
    the A1, completed the following May. As Kiichiro had limited experience with automobile production, he initially focused on truck production;<br>
    the company's first truck, the G1, was completed on August 25, 1935, and debuted on November 21 in Tokyo, becoming the company's first production model.<br>
    [6][10][non-primary source needed] Modeled on a period Ford truck, the G1 sold for ¥2,900, ¥200 cheaper than the Ford truck.<br>
    A total of 379 G1 trucks were ultimately produced.[10][11]<br>
    

    In April 1936, Toyoda's first passenger car, the Model AA, was completed. The sales price was ¥3,350, ¥400 cheaper than Ford or GM cars.<br>
    [12][non-primary source needed] The company's plant at Kariya was completed in May. In July, the company filled its first export order, <br>
    with four G1 trucks exported to northeastern China.[6][non-primary source needed] On September 19, 1936,<br>
    the Japanese imperial government officially designated Toyota Automatic Loom Works as an automotive manufacturer.[6][non-primary source needed]<br>

    The 1936 Toyota AA, the first vehicle produced by the company while it was still a department of Toyota Industries<br>
    Vehicles were originally sold under the name "Toyoda" (トヨダ), from the family name of the company's founder, Kiichirō Toyoda.<br>
    In September 1936, the company ran a public competition to design a new logo. Of 27,000 entries, <br>
    the winning entry was the three Japanese katakana letters for "Toyoda" in a circle. However, Rizaburo Toyoda,<br>
    who had married into the family and was not born with that name, preferred "Toyota" (トヨタ) because it took eight brush strokes<br>
    (a lucky number) to write in Japanese, was visually simpler (leaving off the diacritic at the end),<br>
    and with a voiceless consonant instead of a voiced one (voiced consonants are considered to have a "murky" or "muddy"<br>
    sound compared to voiceless consonants, which are "clear").<br>

    Since toyoda literally means "fertile rice paddies", changing the name also prevented the company from being associated with old-fashioned farming.<br>
    The newly formed word was trademarked and the company began trading on August 28, 1937, as the Toyota Motor Company Ltd.<br>
    [6][13][14][15] Kiichiro's brother-in-law Rizaburo Toyoda was appointed the firm's first president, with Kiichiro as vice-president.<br>
    Toyota Automatic Loom Works formally transferred automobile manufacturing to the new entity on September 29.[6][non-primary source needed]<br>

    The Japanese government supported the company by preventing foreign competitors Ford and General Motors from importing automobiles into Japan.[16]<br>

    At the onset of World War II, Toyota almost exclusively produced standard-sized trucks for the Japanese Army,<br>
    which paid one-fifth of the price in advance and the remainder in cash upon delivery.[17][18]
